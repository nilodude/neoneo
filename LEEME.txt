	-read serial plotter missing manual. (bookmarks: ardu)
	

13/02/22:
	-in order not to fuckup the code, keep audioMode as boolean 
	and add a sign variable for each switch
	
14/02/22:
	-positive starts at led1 and negative starts at led 19
	-going down on audioMode it steps and blinks
	-led 10 ->5V. controlMode should be correctly scaled, 0.5V / led
	
02/05/22:
	-el codigo que estaba cargado (01/05/2022) no era el ultimo.
	-antialiasing: audioMode is filtered and looks ok. try applying same filter to controlMode-> not so easy-> shit result
	-input 2 something wrong. doesnt add with 1 or 3. 1 and 3 add together in 3.
	-lighting out manually instead of strip.clear() gives same result, tested 2 ways (different loops, same loop)
	-check frequency of neopixel in strip declaration --> boom
03/05/22:
	-need to apply envelope or filtering at the leds output. main goal is that it stays steady >50Hz
	-seems that manually lighting off fixes some of the aliasing differences between inputs.
